                Background
              </h2>
              <p>
                Lady Seraphine, born amidst the serene beauty of Lysandra, was the cherished sole heir to King Alaric and Queen Liora. Her birth was marked with prophecies foretelling her unparalleled musical talents that had the power to heal divides and mend wounds. Often escaping the palace confines to mingle with the common folk, young Seraphine's innate curiosity led her to an ancient shrine where she discovered a magical lyre. This connection between the instrument and her voice became Lysandra's beacon of peace, especially during times when neighboring nations threatened their tranquility.

              <p>As she matured, Lady Seraphine's harmonious melodies became synonymous with unity and resilience. Not only was she a princess, but she was also Lysandra's symbol of hope and strength. Through her songs, she constantly reminded her people of the magic within each of them and the potency of unity in the face of adversity.</p>
